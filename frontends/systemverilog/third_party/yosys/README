Files in this directory were copied from Yosys sources and slightly adapted.
Original sources and their license available at https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.

Copied files, their sources, changes & notes:

- const2ast.cc: yosys/frontends/verilog/const2ast.cc (rev. 72787f5)
  - The file is a part of Yosys Verilog frontend, which is not publicly exposed
    by Yosys. Copy has been made to avoid relying on internal details.
  - Changes:
    - C++ includes adapted to not rely on `verilog_frontend.h` file.
    - Removed Yosys namespace; `const2ast()` has been placed inside
      `systemverilog_plugin` namespace to avoid conflicts with the symbol from
      Yosys when statically linking.

Non-copied files placed here for interfacing purposes:

- const2ast.h
